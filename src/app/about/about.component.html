Matt, And then I'm like 'And the dragon comes in the NIIIiiiiIIIiiiiIIIIIIIIiiiiiiiiiiiIIIIIIIIiiiIIGGHHâ€”' But I do have a pretty sweet duck pond simulator for my computer.</p>
            <p>I've been synergizing all morning... And if so, are you some kind of robot? Oh, oh! Oh, right, right. Tight pants. Strong Bad! I don't even wanna see 'em. Here I am in Two Cars, Tennessee, and you know what? You buffoon! Oh yeaaah. Little...bad graphics ghost. Pretty great, huh? Hey! Check it out, man.</p>
